// Missed-workout nudge — one playful notification on the evening of a planned day that went by
// without a workout. Opt-in, under the workout-day reminder (S.reminder.nudge, S.reminder.tone).
//
// The self-hosted app sends it as a web push from the server (api/nudge.js, a hand copy of the
// rules below, as api/queue.js is of lib/queue.js); the mobile build schedules it as a native
// local notification (lib/mobile.js). Both answer the same three questions the same way:
//
//   WHEN  — at 20:00 on the user's clock, or 2 hours after the reminder when that is later, and
//           never after 21:30: a nudge is owed from that time until 21:30, once per day.
//   WHICH — a day is a MISSED day when it has a routine planned (the same plan the reminder
//           reads, coach week/rotation included) and no workout dated on it. A floating coach
//           week or rotation names a session every day until it is done, so on such a day the
//           day right after a workout is a rest day, not a miss — only the second day off in a
//           row counts. A day you left a note on (lib/day-notes.js: sick, travelling, …) is
//           excused, never missed: it is not nudged about and does not count towards the back-off.
//   HOW OFTEN — back-off: the missed days since the last workout are counted (14 days back at
//           most). After 3 of them the nudge goes quiet until the next workout is logged, so a
//           break never turns into a daily nag. No counter is stored anywhere: it is read off
//           the plan and the log, so the server and the phone agree without syncing anything.
//           //// Neoffice — a CLUB may set its own rule instead (S.perms.nudge, Gym Settings): see nudgeFor.
//
// Copy: three tones, one title and four lines each. The line is chosen by the date, so a day
// always gets the same one and consecutive days rotate. Keys are the English source strings;
// api/nudge-copy.js carries the server's copy of their translations (a test keeps the two equal).
